# Micronaut Vue Skeleton
This project is a very simple skeleton to get started to build micro services.

Comes out of the box with:
- A micronaut application skeleton
- A VueJs Frontend and build scripts
- A nginx engine serving static files
- A Mysql database to store some data

## Backend
The backend is a micronaut setup

## Frontend
The frontend is a single (or multi) page application written in vue. An simple nginx setup is used to serve 
static files and route everything to the index.

### Roadmap
- Integrate yarn and node build script into gradle, controlling both node and yarn versions.
